# OTT Platform Analysis Tool
## INTRODUCTION

1.1 Overview:

To analyze different OTT platforms and provide useful information for people who are
not able to decide which platform fits them best. We made a chatbot which helps the
user to get a suggestion of a good movie from various OTT platforms.

1.2 Purpose:

With overabundance of information and multiple criteria to compare various OTT
platforms, it has become increasingly difficult for users to find the best fit for their
tastes. We analyze all the OTT platforms and gives a clear analysis of it so the user can
select the best. Even it helps the people in film business and get a clear idea of the OTT
Platforms.

## LITERATURE SURVEY

2.1 Existing problem:
The way we consume videos has undergone massive changes. Now we have multiple
OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ to stream TV shows
and movies online. With overabundance of information and multiple criteria to compare
various OTT platforms, it has become increasingly difficult for users to find the best fit
for their tastes.

2.2 Proposed solution:
We investigated different OTT platform data sets to provide users with insights into each
platform to determine which services to subscribe to. Amongst multiple factors affecting
online streaming subscriptions, we mainly analyzed number of movies, web series, TV
shows, rating and language.





## RESULT

We discovered distinct characteristics of each OTT platform. From age analytics, we
identified that Netflix had overwhelming TV-MA films compared to other platforms.
Amazon Prime had almost even distribution of different maturity rating films. Disney+
had no movies rated TV-MA and had only those rated TV-PG or TV-G. The result
suggests which platforms to subscribe to depending on the age group of films the users
would like to see more. From genre analytics, we discovered that Netflix and Amazon
Prime had similar distribution. They both had drama, comedy, and action the most.
Nonetheless, Netflix had the most diverse content across all genres. Although Disney+
had much less content compared to the other two, it was the strongest in family, action.
Below are some of the analysis on netflix, prime and hotstar respectively.

## ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES
### Advantages:
- Helps the user to get a quick overview on each OTT platform.
- Helps the user to find a good movie very quickly.
- Helps the producers of movies.
### Disadvantages:
- The data must be updated everytime.
- Analysis gets changed frequently.
- Data handling is difficult.

## APPLICATIONS
- Movie producers who are going to launch the movie in OTT.
- OTT platforms can track the data easily.
- Movie Suggestions.                                                      

## CONCLUSION
We identified that Netflix had overwhelming TV-MA films compared to other platforms.
Amazon Prime had almost even distribution of different maturity rating films. Disney+
had no movies rated TV-MA and had only those rated TV-PG or TV-G. The result
suggests which platforms to subscribe to depending on the age group of films the users
would like to see more. From genre analytics, we discovered that Netflix and Amazon
Prime had similar distribution. They both had drama, comedy, and action the most.
Nonetheless, Netflix had the most diverse content across all genres. Although Disney+
had much less content compared to the other two, it was the strongest in family,
adventure, and animation films. From genome-tag analytics, we could test our goodness
of analytics. Our discoveries in the movieLens analysis were mostly in line with the
results we found through the genre analytics. Netflix and Amazon had a similar trend of
having tags related to drama, comedy, and action while Disney+â€™s tags were more
focused on animated films.

## FUTURE SCOPE
Due to the smaller size of the dataset for original films, partly since the data was limited
to films released till 2021, we believe that further analysis would be necessary with the
addition of recent movies in order to provide a more accurate picture.
